This app cannot be published on the AppStore as changing the default browser on iOS is prohibited by Apple.

To install, you either deploy it by yourself to your device from Xcode OR you can use [Cydia Impactor](http://www.cydiaimpactor.com/) to install the `.ipa` directly from [here](https://github.com/trusk89/iOSSwitchr/releases)).

### Known issues:
1. Brave, Vivaldi, Opera don't work yet

2. Some URLs (I saw the behavior only in the Messages app and in Notes) are not handled as URLs by the OS, so you need to long press on them and than select `Open Link`

3. Need to do some propper organising of the classes, as everything is just thrown in there at this point
